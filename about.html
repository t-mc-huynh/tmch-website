            <p>Everyone has their different parts of themselves that make them who they are. The things that drive them to do better, be better, and get better. These are the things that motivate them and push them at their lowest points, when things get
                hard, and are there when they are having their best days. It is who they are through it all. It's their identify, their values, and the definition of who they are. For me, this is what those things are in my life.</p>

                        flash across my students' faces as they solved their problems. The excitement the students got to start new projects was always contagious and the joy never went away being there with them.</p>
