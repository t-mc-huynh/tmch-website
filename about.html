                hard, and are there when they are having their best days. It is who they are through it all. It's their identify, their values, and the definition of who they are. For me, this is what those things are in my life.</p>

                        I am who I am today because of the values and beliefs I have been taught by my parents and I am grateful for everything they have done for me along the way.</p>

                    <p>My fitness journey. My first day in the gym was like anyone else's - awkward and difficult - but I was excited to learn and willing to put in the work. It was time, I told myself. And thus began a journey that taught me a lot about
                        self-love, patience, endurance, progress, self-limits, and rest. Being active is still today a lovely part of my life and a wonderful way to destress or clear my mind from a long day working.</p>

                        flash across my students' faces as they solved their problems. The excitement the students got to start new projects was always contagious and the joy never went away being there with them.</p>

                team management. My curiousity and passion drives me to proceed with my tasks as efficiently and effectively as possible while maintaining clear communication with management and teammates.</p>
