  Everyone has their different parts of themselves that make them who they are. The
  things that drive them to do better, be better, and get better. These are the things
  that motivate them and push them at their lowest points, when things get hard, and 
  are there when they are having their best days. It is who they are through it all. 
  It's their identify, their values, and the definition of who they are. For me, this 
  is what those things are in my life.

        My family. Even though my family  may be small and reserved, they are
        the most supportive and loving family I can ask for. They have always
        been there for me through every struggling moment and every celebrating
        success in my life. I am who I am today because of the values and beliefs
        I have been taught by my parents and I am grateful for everything they
        have done for me along the way.

        Teaching/Mentoring. Starting out at a young age, I fell in love with
        teaching, tutoring, and mentoring those younger than me and my own peers.
        As soon as I could, I started teaching jobs and fell in love with seeing
        the lightbulb moment flash across my students' faces as they solved their
        problems. The excitement the students got to start new projects was always
        contagious and the joy never went away being there with them.

        My fitness journey. My first day in the gym was like anyone else's - awkward
        and difficult - but I was excited to learn and willing to put in the work.
        It was time, I told myself. And thus began a journey that taught me a lot
        about self-love, patience, endurance, progress, self-limits, and rest. Being
        active is still today a lovely part of my life and a wonderful way to destress
        or clear my mind from a long day working.

        Technology. Modern-day technology is our day-to-day lives as it will be
        our future. But how we use it will decide whether it controls us or we
        control it. My curiousity of technological advancements has guided me down
        this path in which my goal is to motivate and help society to live a more
        connected and healthy life by placing easy-to-use and advance technology at
        their fingertips alongside the limiting agents that motivate personal to
        stay present day-to-day outside their screens.
