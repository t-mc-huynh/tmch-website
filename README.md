# Welcome to tmchuynh

My journey started with the medical field, ventured off into engineering, business, and landed me back into the tech industry where my youngest creative curiosities first flowed. Back when iPhones still had these icons ( ), I had been sitting in my parents' room curious who developed the software updates for the iOS, how I could become one, and what great of a job that would be to be able to be so creative and impact. I was probably in elementary school, waiting for my phone to update as I laid on the carpet floor. I wrote an article about these memories once - [read it here.](https://www.bridge-to-connect.org/blog-articles/discovering-my-field)

In this particular project, I used DEV.to's API to transfer my daily articles from my <a href="https://dev.to/tmchuynh">DEV.to profile</a> onto my personal website. I also have displayed my DevCard from daily.dev that can also be seen from my GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/tmchuynh">README.md</a> page. In the near future, I have plans to:
[ ] Implement an automation for my DevCard to update, similar to my profile README.md via GitHub actions
[ ] Import my past projects into a section
[ ] Add my contact information below the introduction section
