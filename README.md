# A Personal and Professional Website

## My Inspiration

Experienced developers from multiple platforms and from all parts of the globe have come together to inspire, to motivate, and to plant seeds of curiousity as I began my journey into front-end development. It was reading articles on Medium and DEV Community that nudged me into the correct directions in terms of languages and projects. Platforms such as Dribble, Behance, and Instagram are my new uses of inspiration for creativity and to learn how to design and utilize the components I am not too familiar with yet.

## My Goals

Today is a starting point and tomorrow is a new adventure. There is always something new to learn. My portfolio is my way to present my most recent projects along with the projects I am most proud of to present to you. Hi, nice to meet you.

When starting my personal website, I did not expect to end up compiling a list of upcoming project I would want to create with my new skills. Each skill I learned, I found five more skills I wanted to learn. So then, the wheels continued to turn.
